# Patient Progress REST API

REST API to React Native project for CFG Hack from Home 2020 Hackathon. Patient Progress is an app that would automate the process of updating the emergency contacts of a patient with the development of the patient in quarantine.

Our application was designed to use the existing data from NHS in order to create an interactive feed. However, for our demo, this REST API is meant to serve this purpose.
